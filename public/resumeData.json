It took just a matter of hours before he had internalized the project code and made a plan to make it considerably more efficient and easy to understand. He works seamlessly on his own and with others, is well-respected and appreciated by his colleagues, and carries and ethic and initiative that lets him bring elegant solutions to complex problems. I was sad to lose him, and whoever gets him next will be very, very lucky to have him.",
